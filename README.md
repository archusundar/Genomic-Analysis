This code utilizes RCAS package to identify the genomic coordinates of Clip-seq data where the input file is from the clip seq analysis (Bed formatted file)
This code helps to identify the location of the peaks in the genomic regions such as 3', 5' and CDS regions. Further, the code can help identify the motif regions.
In addition, Functional enrichment analysis of genes can also be determined using this code.

Libraries required (RCAS, dplyr, ggplot2, knitr, ggseqlogo)
